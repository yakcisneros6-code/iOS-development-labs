# iOS Development Labs

This repository contains structured Swift and SwiftUI labs completed as part of my iOS Development program at MTECH.

The projects and labs focus on:
- Swift fundamentals and basic types
- Control flow and functions
- Structs, classes, and object-oriented concepts
- SwiftUI views, navigation, lists, forms, and state
- MVVM architecture patterns
- Basic networking and APIs
- SwiftData and data persistence
- Concurrency and generics

Each folder represents a lab or project that demonstrates my growing skills in building iOS applications.

This repo reflects my learning progress as a pre-graduation iOS developer focused on becoming an Engineering Intern.
